# piConnect

PiConnect will Connect your phone to your Raspberry Pi! 
Turn on your Pi, Turn on your phone, and select the scripts you wrote to be ran!
You can send any number of arguments and custom commands.

# TODO
We eventually will want to publish a tutorial setting up the webserver, forwarding the port, and the users can either clone the API repo or maybe there's a way to publish it. Include link to download App on PlayStore :D
